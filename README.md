I used VS Code in conjunction with GitHub

Bot saves princess

The princess is trapped in one of the four corners of a grid, and my goal is to find and free her. 
For this coding challenge, I utilized Python to locate the princess; it is the closest coding language to Ruby I know. I determined where the princess was by using the grid that was given, and knowing the bot was placed in the middle from the instructions.
Using Python, I created four different moves: UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT to find the princess. 
By initially setting the bot at position [0] and the princess at position [0], I was able to incrementally increase the moves (spaces) by +1 or -1 with the help of < (less than) or > (greater than). I was then able to denote and calculate the different moves.

Bot saves princess 2

The princess is once again trapped, this time, the bot and the princess can be anywhere. I was given four parameters (N, r, c, grid). The output will show the next move to the princess. The valid movements are LEFT, RIGHT, UP, and DOWN. I defined the valid movements, as well as defining m = bot and p = princess.
